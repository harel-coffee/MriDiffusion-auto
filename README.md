# MriDiffusion
Effectiveness of IVIM and CTRW parameters of predicting malignant lesion in breast cancer.  The dataset is not public, so it is not included.

The dataset, however, only had a small sample size (~40) so we only used histogram features. 

You will also need the [BorutaPy](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py "BourtaPy").  I modified the file to indicate specific importance feature values
and have also uploaded this into the repo.
